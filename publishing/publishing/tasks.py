"""The job that brings a station's published record up to date.

A job only carries the station id and publishes its current record. The status
on the station is the source of truth: a save always sets it to pending, so a
job that no longer finds its own `processing` at the end knows a newer save came
in. The rest of the state is in Valkey (state.py).

Retries are manual: a failure makes the station failed, and a user retries it. A
crashed job isn't run again automatically either. Its lock expires by itself and
a user's retry starts over.

Django is imported inside the functions: this module is loaded while Celery
starts, before Django is set up."""
