"""Plugin interfaces.

A MessageGenerator turns an Event into Messages and a TransportLayer delivers
them. A Publisher is one publishing process from start to end: an ordered list
of Steps, each pairing a generator with a transport. Each step gets the
Deliveries (receipts) of the steps before it in the same publisher. Publishers
know nothing about each other, and one failing doesn't affect the others.

Byte-level consistency: a storage transport returns the Location of what it
stored. Before a generator that needs_content() runs, its Publisher
retrieves every earlier Location and hands over the file actually served, so
e.g. a WNM's integrity always describes the stored file.

Each worker process has its own instance of each plugin and runs one job at a
time, so plugins don't have to be thread-safe."""
